# AI Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet

This repository hosts the development of an interactive cheat sheet aimed at helping AI enthusiasts, researchers, and developers create more precise and effective prompts for AI language models.

## Project Description

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the AI Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet provides a variety of categorized prompts such as "persona", "tone", and "format". Each category presents several example prompts accompanied by a generic application and a "Copy to Clipboard" button for ease of use. 

## Current Progress

The project is a work-in-progress, with basic structure and functionality in place. Current features include:
- Categorized prompts with examples
- A "Copy to Clipboard" button for each example
- Basic responsive layout

## Future Plans

I plan to continuously improve and update the cheat sheet, including:
- Enhancing the UI/UX design 
- Incorporating more example prompts
- Enabling user contributions of new prompts
- Implementing advanced features such as user customization and bookmarking favorite prompts
